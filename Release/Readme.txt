This archive contains TrueCrypt 4.0 setup and documentation.


IMPORTANT -- PLEASE READ
========================

If you have never used TrueCrypt before, we recommend that you read the
chapter "Beginner's Tutorial" in the TrueCrypt User Guide, which can be
found in the 'Setup Files' folder. 



If you are upgrading from an older version of TrueCrypt, it is normally 
not necessary to uninstall it first. However, if any errors are reported
during the process of installation, please uninstall the older version
first, restart the operating system, and then try to install the new
version again. To uninstall TrueCrypt, click Start Menu -> Settings ->
-> Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs -> TrueCrypt ->
-> Change/Remove). Note that when you uninstall TrueCrypt, no TrueCrypt
volume is removed (nor affected in any way).


IMPORTANT NOTE TO USERS UPGRADING FROM TRUECRYPT 3.0 OR 3.0A: Note that 
after you upgrade to this new version of TrueCrypt, due to a bug in v3.0 
and 3.0a, it will not be possible to mount hidden volumes created with 
TrueCrypt 3.0 or 3.0a located on some removable media, e.g., some USB 
memory sticks (does not apply to file-hosted containers). If that is the 
case, please before upgrading to this new version, move your files to a 
temporary TrueCrypt volume on a non-removable medium or to a non-hidden 
volume on a removable medium, and move the data from the old hidden 
volume to this temporary one. Then install this new version of 
TrueCrypt, create a new hidden volume, and move your files from the 
temporary volume to it. Please see the 'Version History' in the 
documentation for more information. 


IMPORTANT NOTE TO USERS UPGRADING FROM TRUECRYPT 2.1 OR EARLIER:
TrueCrypt volumes encrypted using the IDEA encryption algorithm cannot
be mounted using this version. If you have such a volume, before
upgrading, please create a new TrueCrypt volume using a cipher other
than IDEA and move your files to this new volume.


Before using TrueCrypt, we recommend that you read the TrueCrypt User
Guide, which can be found in the 'Setup Files' folder. To view or print
it, you will need Adobe Acrobat Reader (which is freely available at
http://www.adobe.com). Note that the program documentation is also
automatically copied to the folder to which TrueCrypt is installed, and 
will be accessible via the Start menu and the TrueCrypt user interface.

- Any of the following operating systems:
  Windows XP, Windows 2000, Windows Server 2003
